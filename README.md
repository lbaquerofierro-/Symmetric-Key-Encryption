# Symmetric-Key-Encryption

- This program uses pycrypto and SHA256
- A mode should be specified before the file is encrypted or decrypted. The program supports CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR. 
- When a file is encrypted, it is stored with the name "(encrypted)fileName" where fileName is the name of the file originally  encrypted
- getpass() is used so that the password is stored but not echoed
